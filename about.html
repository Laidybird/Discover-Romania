        <h2>Quick facts about Romania</h2>
        <br>
        <img src="images/cantacuzino_castle-pages-header-image.jpeg" alt="" style="width:100%">
        <br>
        <p>Located in Eastern Europe, Romania is the 9th largest country in Europe by surface with a rich and diverse
            geography and incredible natural sights. It ranks 6th by population (approx. 19 mil) composed of 85%
            Romanians and other ethnic minorities such as Hungarians, Germans, Italian, Turks or Rroma. Romania is a
            NATO member since 2004 and part of the European Union since 2007.

            The capital or Romania is Bucharest with approx. 2,2 mil people. The second largest city is Cluj-Napoca (0,5
            mil) followed by Timisoara, Iasi and Constanta. The local time in Romania is Eastern European Time (EET)
            +02:00 GMT

            There are many reasons why it's worth visiting Romania. Top tourist attractions include medieval castles
            (the famous Bran Castle or Peles Castle) mixed with communist sights (the huge Palace of Parliament), lots
            of natural parks in the wild Carpathian Mountains, unique sights such as Turda Salt Mine or Hoia Baciu
            Forest, the UNESCO Danube Delta biosphere or the famous Transfagarasan Highway.</p>
        <p>Another big reason for visiting Romania is its countryside life and charm, which is like an ageing but
            charming living history museum. Small villages scattered around picturesque hills where a simple, peaceful
            and archaic way of life is well-preserved by friendly and wise locals who grow their own food. There are 3
            regions where this can be experienced, each with its own culture and flavours.
            <img src="images/transfagarasan_at_camilg.jpeg" alt="" style="width: 100%">
            Transylvania is undoubtedly the most famous and a big highlight of Romanian tourism. The famous ethnographic
            region of Maramures (North-West) with its famous UNESCO Wooden Churches and folk costumes is likewise
            popular. And finally, Bukovina (North-East) with its 400-year-old UNESCO Painted Churches and egg-painting
            tradition. Our travel tip - if you want to get a great experience visiting any of these regions, you'll need
            at least 3 days!

        <h2>Romania History</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Romanian history is like Game of Thrones but without the fantasy part: at the intersection of Ottoman,
            Austro-Hungarian and Russian (later Soviet) empires, our history is full of twists and turns. Always caught
            between wars, invasions and foreign domination (hence the numerous castles and fortifications!), our history
            is a testimony of our nation's resilience, clarity and determination to unite the 3 historical provinces
            (Transylvania, Wallachia and Moldova) into an independent state which only happened in 1918.</p>
        <p>As for Romanian culture and people, you'll see Romanians are very friendly and hospitable with a taste for
            enjoying life, food and people. Our Latin blood and cultural affinity mixes with Balkan society and Eastern
            appreciation for beauty and traditional values. Although there are some prejudices and misconceptions about
            our country and people, people who've visited our country were always pleasantly surprised and impressed by
            what it can offer - and we hope you'll be too!

            Now, on to the practical travel tips with things to know about visiting Romania:</p>
        <h2>Conditions for entry & visa requirements.</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Citizens of European Union countries do not require a visa to enter Romania. Citizens from all other
            countries of the world may be subject to getting a visa. Check the conditions of entry from our Ministry of
            Foreign Affairs and the list of countries for which a visa is (or not!) required. Some nationalities (e.g.
            US, British, Canadian) don't need a visa when entering Romania if they stay under 90 days.

            You can apply for a visa online on the Ministry's (only) official website. Holders of a Schengen visa with
            multiple entries (and slots still available and valid!) are not required to apply for a Romanian visa.</p>
        <h2>Romanian currency, exchange houses and card payments</h2>
        <br>
        <img src="images/romanian_money_lei.jpeg" alt="" style="width: 100%">
        <br>
        <p>The Romanian currency is Leu (RON) or Lei in plural and can be found in notes of 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 200 and
            500, all plastic and almost indestructible! 1 Leu is divided into "bani" which are coins of 50, 10 and
            smaller-donâ€™t-matter coins. Although some prices in Romania are also displayed or calculated in Euros using
            Euros for cash payments is NOT accepted and if someone offers you an 'in-house' exchange rate - you should
            check official rates before accepting.

            1 Euro is about 5 Lei and 1 USD is about 4,3 Lei - check official exchange rates published by the Romanian
            National Bank here); prices in Romania are generally cheaper than in Western European countries: with 1 Euro
            you can buy: 2 x 0.5 bottles of water or a two-way bus/tram ride in most cities or 1-2 snacks from a street
            pastry shop
            Paying by card is very common and safe in Romania in all shops, restaurants, hotels or tourist attractions
            (but not taxis!), especially in major cities. Bank cards issued by VISA, MasterCard and Maestro are widely
            accepted everywhere, but American Express cards don't always work. If you're using a credit card from a
            non-EU bank, make sure it's authorised for international payments (also when booking tours on our website!).
            When travelling outside of cities, in the countryside, mountains or remote areas cash is king so always have
            Lei with you and plan your budget ahead. Some village guesthouses or restaurants don't take card payments so
            ask in advance.</p>
        <h2>Weather, climate and when to visit Romania</h2>
        <p>Romania has a temperate continental climate which used to be codename for standard weather. But in recent
            years, perhaps due to the climate changing, the transition periods between seasons are getting shorter,
            Summers (June-September) are hotter with averages of 32-38 C and less rainy. Winters (December-January) are
            still cold but less snowy in the cities, more so in the mountainous areas. Spring (March-May) and Autumn
            (Sept-Nov) are unpredictable as ever: cold in the mornings and evenings (8-18 C), warm and sunny during the
            day (18-26 C).

            The best time to visit Romania depends on your interests. For sightseeing come anytime April - October when
            the weather is fair and days are longer. For food and wine tourism (which is growing in popularity!) the
            best time is August - Oct.

            The best time to go hiking is from early May to mid-October. It also depends where you're going because in
            the high mountains (Fagaras, Piatra Craiului, Bucegi) there can still be snow until June and weather can be
            unpredictable - and unpleasant - at altitudes of over 1,800m. But our hiking guides will help you plan the
            trip and check weather conditions locally.

            For wildlife tours - we follow nature's rhythm. Animals - including bears! - are most active during late
            Spring (early May)- mid Autumn (Oct) depending on how warm and cold it is. The best time with the highest
            chances of seeing wild animals roaming around (incl. wolves, boars, chamois or buffalos) is during Summer
            but these trips are more challenging logistically and in high demand so please contact us in advance.</p>

        <h2>Where to stay in Romania. Booking hotels, guesthouses and homes</h2>
        <br>
        <img src="images/moutain_cabin.jpg" alt="" style="width: 100%">
        <br>
        <p>Romania offers lots of accommodation choices for all budgets, requirements or styles. All of them are listed
            on either Booking.com or AirBnB - spend some time on both to find the right place for you to stay on your
            holiday.

            In tourist cities you'll find the usual selection of hostels, hotels and boutique guesthouses. Plenty of
            apart-hotels too as a lot of Romanians made a side-business out of this in pre-Covid times. If you're
            staying in Bucharest, choose a place close to a metro station as it will be the fastest and cheapest way to
            navigate the large city. All the other tourist cities are not that big so even if you're not staying in the
            "old town" or "union square" area (usually the city centre), it will probably be a 15 min walk away.

            When visiting the tourist regions of Romania (Transylvania, Maramures, Bukovina, Danube Delta) accommodation
            usually means a family-owned guesthouse called pensiune or casa - and no hotels. That's normal and in fact
            you'll have a better experience as the owners are usually around to make sure guests get the best treatment.
            Most of them offer half or full board (aka delicious home-cooked meals with locally sourced ingredients) and
            we suggest you take it since there will be few other alternatives to eat out. Just read their reviews
            carefully before booking.

            For hiking trips, there are guesthouses in villages at the base of the mountains. But sometimes the hiking
            trails or entrance to natural parks begin a little further away and you can get there only by car. When deep
            in the mountains you'll have at most 1-2 choices of mountain cabins or chalets as Romania's hiking
            infrastructure is not very well developed. Due to their very limited capacity and very high demand, booking
            hiking trips in advance (minimum 2-3 weeks) is recommended. But if you want to just spend some time in the
            mountains, enjoy the views and fresh air then you'll have lots of beautiful cabins to choose from - all of
            which are accessible only by car.</p>

            food, handcrafts long forgotten and a simple way of life in small local communities. This is responsible
